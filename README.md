# Video 1: Project setup. 
- Cloned starter project
- Installed dependancies
- Added cypress to the project
- Created input-form.spec.js and had it load the react TODO app. 

# Video 2: Text Inputs. 
- Added second test to enter input into .new-todo.
- Modified TodoApp and TodoForm to handle text entry
- Modified tests to perform beforeEach and visit the site.
- abstracted the url to cypress.json as baseUrl
- verified all tests run
